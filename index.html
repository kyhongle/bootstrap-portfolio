                        While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens. Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr.
                </p>
                <p>
                        With 48 recognised cat breeds and pedigrees in Australia plus an endless combination of cross breeds it's amazing just how different each cat can look and behave. But there are many amazing physical characteristics that all cats possess, read on for more fascinating facts about your feline friend.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes, known as the tapetum lucidum, which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light. Cats (as well as dogs) also have a ‘third eyelid’ called the nictitating membrane which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.</li>
                  <li>Cats have 32 muscles in their ears (humans have only 12). This gives the ear mobility, enabling it to precisely locate prey such as mice or the opening of their cat food! Cats can also hear frequencies that are both below and above those that can be heard by humans. The ear also has the job of helping to maintain balance and the ability to right themselves when falling – which is where the phrase “Cats always land on their feet” came from.</li>
                  <li>Cats can retract their front claws. This keeps them sharp so they can be used for climbing and of course, as effective weapons!</li>
